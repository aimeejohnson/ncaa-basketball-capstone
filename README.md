# Foul Play: Uncovering Trends in NCAA Women's Basketball

## Motivation
NCAA women’s basketball is experiencing a surge in popularity. The 2024 NCAA Women’s Final Four Championship between the Iowa Hawkeyes and South Carolina Gamecocks drew an impressive [18.9 million viewers](https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2024/04/2024-ncaa-womens-championship-and-final-four-on-espn-platforms-is-most-watched-on-record/), setting a new ESPN record for the most-watched college basketball game of all time, regardless of gender. In contrast, the previous year’s Championship game between the LSU Tigers and Iowa Hawkeyes garnered 9.9 million viewers.

Although the popularity of women's basketball has grown, it has been accompanied by a rise in unfair and negative media portrayals. In 2024, Los Angeles Times columnist Ben Bolch wrote [an article](https://www.latimes.com/sports/ucla/story/2024-03-29/ucla-lsu-america-sweethearts-versus-basketball-villains) where he referred to the LSU Women's Basketball team as 'dirty debutantes' while describing the UCLA team as 'being as wholesome as a miniature stuffed Bruin mascot'. Dawn Staley, the coach of South Carolina's team, has often defended the media's portrayal of her athletes by stating ['we're not bar fighters'](https://nypost.com/2023/04/01/dawn-staley-rails-against-south-carolina-bar-fighters-narrative/).

## Project Overview
This project aims to investigate demographic differences across women's basketball programs and determine whether more diverse conferences produced a higher frequency of fouls during the 2023-2024 season. If we don't see any trends, what is affecting the way fouls are being called? Additionally, it seeks to analyze patterns in foul occurrences to help teams strategize more effectively and avoid negative media coverage.

## Questions
1) What are the demographic differences across Power Five conferences?
2) Are there notable trends in women's college basketball when analyzing demographic data, particularly in relation to player performance and outcomes?
3) Do conferences with greater racial or ethnic diversity experience more personal foul calls, and are specific types of players more likely to receive these calls?
4) What key factors or player characteristics are strong predictors of personal fouls in NCAA women's basketball?
5) If diversity isn't a significant factor in determining foul calls, what other variables might better explain the patterns?

## Conclusion
Pac-12 had the highest percentage of non-white female athletes, while the Big Ten had the lowest. Black women have been the largest demographic in women’s basketball over the past decade regardless of conference, although that percentage has decreased overtime. There was no clear relationship between conference diversity and personal fouls per game. However, getting roster specific demographics may help further investigate potential racial bias. There was a strong correlation between aggressive offensive styles like steals per game and pace and personal fouls per game.

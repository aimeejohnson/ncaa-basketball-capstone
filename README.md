# Foul Play: Uncovering Trends in NCAA Women's Basketball

## Motivation
NCAA women’s basketball is experiencing a surge in popularity. The 2024 NCAA Women’s Final Four Championship between the Iowa Hawkeyes and South Carolina Gamecocks drew an impressive [18.9 million viewers](https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2024/04/2024-ncaa-womens-championship-and-final-four-on-espn-platforms-is-most-watched-on-record/), setting a new ESPN record for the most-watched college basketball game of all time, regardless of gender. In contrast, the previous year’s Championship game between the LSU Tigers and Iowa Hawkeyes garnered 9.9 million viewers.

Although the popularity of women's basketball has grown, it has been accompanied by a rise in unfair and negative media portrayals. In 2024, Los Angeles Times columnist Ben Bolch wrote [an article](https://www.latimes.com/sports/ucla/story/2024-03-29/ucla-lsu-america-sweethearts-versus-basketball-villains) where he referred to the LSU Women's Basketball team as 'dirty debutantes' while describing the UCLA team as 'being as wholesome as a miniature stuffed Bruin mascot'. Dawn Staley, the coach of South Carolina's team, has often defended the media's portrayal of her athletes by stating ['we're not bar fighters'](https://nypost.com/2023/04/01/dawn-staley-rails-against-south-carolina-bar-fighters-narrative/). 

Using fouls as a benchmark for 'agressive play', this project aims to investigate demographic differences across women's basketball programs and determine whether certain conferences produced a higher frequency of fouls during the 2023-2024 season. Additionally, it seeks to analyze patterns in foul occurrences to help teams strategize more effectively and avoid negative 'aggressive play' media coverage.
